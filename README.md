# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Lab

This project contains a practical example of performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## Overview

The goal of this notebook is to:

- Understand the structure of the dataset.
- Clean and preprocess data.
- Identify trends and relationships between features.
- Visualize data distributions, correlations, and potential outliers.

This kind of analysis is an essential first step in the data science process and helps in informing the development of predictive models or business insights.

## Tools and Libraries

The project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- `pandas` – Data manipulation and analysis
- `matplotlib` – Basic plotting
- `seaborn` – Statistical data visualization
- `numpy` – Numerical computing

## Features Visualized

- Histograms
- Box plots
- Scatter plots
- Pair plots
- Correlation heatmaps

## Example Visualizations

Here are a few examples of the visualizations created in the notebook:
